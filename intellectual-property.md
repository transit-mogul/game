# Transit Mogul Intellectual Property (IP)

As with many open source projects, the IP for Transit Mogul is a bit jumbled.

Transit Mogul is a hard fork of OpenTTD, which itself is an open source clone of Transport Tycoon.


## Code

Transit Mogul is a large project with lots of core code and 3rd party components.

### Core

All of the core code is licensed under the GPL.
New code since the fork is copyrighted to Ricardo N Feliciano (me), and under the GPL v3.
Existing code as of the fork is licensed to The OpenTTD Team under the GPL v2.
Most of the OpenTTD original code will say so within the file.

### Components

There's several components with various licenses. This section will be written out better in the future.


## Graphics

Currently Transit Mogul uses the aBase in-game graphics, which is a fork of zBase.
Both of which are GPL graphics packs.

## Summary

As far as I know, no code, either from Transit Mogul or originally OpenTTD, has any copyright or affiliation to Transport Tycoon and Microprose.


## Trademarks

### Transit Mogul

Transit Mogul is a name trademarked to Ricardo N Feliciano (me), the creator of the this fork.

### OpenTTD

OpenTTD is a name trademarked to the OpenTTD Team. Due to the international nature of the team, I'm not sure which country's laws apply, and to whom.

### Transport Tycoon

Transport Tycoon is a name trademarked to Microprose Software, Inc, the creator of the original game and a few sequels.
